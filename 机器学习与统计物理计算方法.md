## Statistical mechanics 
Statistical mechanics is a branch of physics that uses probability theory to study the behavior of large systems of particles. 
In statistical mechanics, s is the entropy of a system, p(s) is the probability distribution of the entropy, and z is the partition function. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system.

### Ising model
$$磁性材料的相变行为$$
The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. It is used to study the behavior of magnetic materials and their phase transitions.
